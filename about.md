I am a computer scientist living and working in the San Francisco Bay Area.
From 2014 to 2020, I was a Software Engineer in [Google Brain](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/), where I helped to create [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
Before that, from 2011 to 2014, I was a Researcher at [Microsoft Research Silicon Valley](http://msrsvc.org/). I graduated with a PhD in Computer Science from the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/), an MSc in High Performance Computing from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/), and a BSc in Computing Science from the [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/).
