I am a computer scientist living and working in the San Francisco Bay Area. From 2014 to 2020, I was a Software Engineer in Google Brain, where I helped to create TensorFlow. Before that, from 2011 to 2014, I was a Researcher at Microsoft Research Silicon Valley. I graduated with a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, an MSc in High Performance Computing from the University of Edinburgh, and a BSc in Computing Science from the University of Glasgow.
